## The motivation:

The high rates of unemployment in India can be battled by increasing the employability of people. The 20–24 age group is one of the largest groups of unemployed people, of which college graduates constitute a big portion. Colleges can drastically reduce the number of unemployed graduates by introducing courses and changing the curriculum to help develop the skills that employers look for in graduates. We built a system that helps analyze the difference in the skill sets of placed and not placed students. It predicts whether a student with a given skill set would be able to secure a job or not. It uses not only technical skills but also takes into consideration other soft skills which are essential to land a job

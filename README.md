## The motivation:

The high rates of unemployment in India can be battled by increasing the employability of people. The 20–24 age group is one of the largest groups of unemployed people, of which college graduates constitute a big portion. Colleges can drastically reduce the number of unemployed graduates by introducing courses and changing the curriculum to help develop the skills that employers look for in graduates. We built a system that helps in self analyzing the skill sets and your shortcomigs. It predicts whether a student with a given skill set would be able to secure a job or not. It uses not only technical skills but also takes into consideration other soft skills which are essential to land a job.

## How it works :

Through this app one can predict his or her oncampus and offcampus placemets . The app takes into consideration of Stream, backlogs, internships, location to predict oncampus placements. A student can also predict his/ her ability to get a role through offcampus. The model shows the job the candidate should apply onto based on his/ her  skills and nature. Also one can get DSA practice resources and upcoming contests from here.
